Prompt for Replit to Redesign All Components with Edujiin’s Brand Colors
Prompt for Replit:

Redesign the entire Edujiin platform, including all components (e.g., WelcomePage.tsx, EduBot.tsx, UniversitySearch.tsx, DocumentDrafting.tsx, JobFinding.tsx, ScholarshipFinder.tsx, CulturalSupport.tsx, OnCampusSupport.tsx, PostGraduationGuidance.tsx, FamilySupport.tsx, ResearchCollaboration.tsx, HolisticProfileEvaluation.tsx, MentalHealthResources.tsx), CSS files (e.g., styles.css, Tailwind configuration), and any inline HTML styles, to create a modern, cohesive, and user-friendly design. Take inspiration from Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/) for a clean, professional, and vibrant aesthetic, but adapt it to use Edujiin’s brand colors and logo-inspired elements. Analyze the entire codebase to identify all styling elements (colors, grids, layouts, buttons, input forms, hover states, etc.) and redesign them to align with Edujiin’s brand identity. Follow these specifications:

Key Objectives:

Create a modern, clean, and professional design inspired by Coursera’s aesthetic (e.g., clear spacing, modern typography, intuitive layouts), but adapted to Edujiin’s brand colors and style.
Identify and update all UI elements (buttons, input forms, hover states, grids, text, backgrounds, icons, etc.) across all components, CSS files, and inline HTML styles to use Edujiin’s brand colors: Deep Blue (#1E3A8A) for primary elements (e.g., headers, primary buttons), Medium Teal (#2DD4BF) for secondary elements (e.g., hover states, links, icons), Light Minty Green (#A7F3D0) for background highlights or gradients, Lighter Medium Blue (#60A5FA) for tertiary accents (e.g., borders, subtle decorations), White/Off-White (#F9FAFB) for main backgrounds, and Dark Gray (#1F2937) for text on light backgrounds.
Ensure all components are redesigned for usability, with proper spacing, visual hierarchy, and responsive design (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Add subtle decorative elements (e.g., swirls/dots inspired by the Edujiin logo) in Lighter Medium Blue (#60A5FA) for swirls and Medium Teal (#2DD4BF) for dots, with 20% opacity, to enhance the brand identity.
Maintain all functionality while updating the design, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Redesign Guidelines:

Buttons:
Primary buttons: Deep Blue (#1E3A8A) background, white text, rounded (8px), 12px padding, Medium Teal (#2DD4BF) hover state with a slight scale effect (e.g., hover:scale-105).
Secondary buttons: Medium Teal (#2DD4BF) background, white text, rounded (8px), 12px padding, Deep Blue (#1E3A8A) hover state.
Input Forms:
Background: White/Off-White (#F9FAFB).
Border: Lighter Medium Blue (#60A5FA), 2px width, rounded (4px).
Focus state: Border changes to Medium Teal (#2DD4BF) with a subtle glow (e.g., focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[#2DD4BF]).
Placeholder text: Dark Gray (#1F2937).
Override autofill styles:
css

Copy
input:-webkit-autofill,
input:-webkit-autofill:hover,
input:-webkit-autofill:focus {
  background-color: #F9FAFB !important;
  -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 0 30px #F9FAFB inset !important;
  border-color: #60A5FA !important;
}
Hover States:
Links: Medium Teal (#2DD4BF) text, Deep Blue (#1E3A8A) hover state with an underline.
Cards/Sections: Add a subtle hover effect with a Light Minty Green (#A7F3D0) background tint and a slight scale effect (e.g., hover:scale-102).
Buttons: As specified above (Deep Blue to Medium Teal or vice versa).
Grids and Layouts:
Use a responsive grid layout inspired by Coursera (e.g., grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4 for dashboards or feature cards).
Ensure proper spacing between elements (e.g., gap-4 for grids, p-4 or p-6 for padding, space-y-2 for vertical spacing).
Background for grid containers: White/Off-White (#F9FAFB) with a subtle Light Minty Green (#A7F3D0) gradient for highlighted sections.
Text and Typography:
Headings: Deep Blue (#1E3A8A), text-xl to text-3xl depending on hierarchy, bold.
Body text: Dark Gray (#1F2937) on light backgrounds, white on Deep Blue or Medium Teal backgrounds.
Use a modern sans-serif font (e.g., font-sans) for readability.
Backgrounds and Containers:
Main backgrounds: White/Off-White (#F9FAFB).
Highlighted sections (e.g., hero, pricing): Light Minty Green (#A7F3D0) with a subtle gradient to Medium Teal (#2DD4BF).
Cards: White/Off-White (#F9FAFB) with a subtle shadow (shadow-sm), rounded corners (8px), and a hover effect (Light Minty Green background tint).
Icons and Decorations:
Icons: Medium Teal (#2DD4BF) for default, Lighter Medium Blue (#60A5FA) on hover.
Decorative elements: Add swirls and dots (Lighter Medium Blue #60A5FA for swirls, Medium Teal #2DD4BF for dots, 20% opacity) to headers, cards, or sections for brand consistency.
Implementation Steps:

Analyze Source Code:
Search all component files (e.g., WelcomePage.tsx, EduBot.tsx, UniversitySearch.tsx, etc.), CSS files (e.g., styles.css, Tailwind configuration), and inline HTML styles for current color usage, layouts, grids, and UI elements.
Identify all buttons, input forms, hover states, grids, text, backgrounds, icons, and other elements that need redesigning.
Redesign with Brand Colors:
Update all UI elements according to the redesign guidelines above, ensuring consistency across the application.
Replace any non-brand colors (e.g., yellow, if still present, or other colors like red, green) with Edujiin’s brand colors, following the guidelines.
For input forms, ensure proper styling and override autofill styles as specified.
Enhance Design with Coursera Inspiration:
Adopt Coursera’s clean layout principles:
Use a grid layout for feature cards (e.g., grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4).
Ensure generous spacing (e.g., p-4, gap-4, space-y-2).
Apply modern typography (e.g., font-sans, text-xl for headings).
Use subtle shadows and rounded corners for cards (shadow-sm, rounded-lg).
Adapt Coursera’s vibrant button and hover styles to use Edujiin’s colors (e.g., Deep Blue buttons with Medium Teal hover).
Add Decorative Elements:
Include subtle swirls and dots (Lighter Medium Blue #60A5FA for swirls, Medium Teal #2DD4BF for dots, 20% opacity) in headers, cards, and highlighted sections to reflect the Edujiin logo aesthetic.
Testing and Validation:
Test the updated design across all components for visual consistency, ensuring all elements use Edujiin’s brand colors.
Verify responsiveness (desktop, tablet, mobile) and dark/light mode support using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.
Ensure accessibility (e.g., high contrast ratios, screen reader support) by checking text readability (e.g., white text on Deep Blue, Dark Gray on White/Off-White).
Confirm all functionality (e.g., buttons, links, forms) remains intact after the redesign, with a focus on input forms working correctly (e.g., no unexpected colors on autofill).
